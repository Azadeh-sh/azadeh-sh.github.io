                <h2>Developer Panel Dashboard Redesign</h2>
                <p> Redesigning how developers access and analyze their apps and how can we make it effective and friendly for them.</p>
                <p>Our data shows that most of the users have just one or two apps or just some of them have data and usage and they want to have a brief report of their apps also they have to cruise on the menu to find more repetitive action buttons.</p>

                <h2>Talking to users</h2>
                <p>To understand the case better, I talked to the support team who had a direct connection with developers, and also talked to different developers. By doing this I captured how they use the dashboard too and what value they took from it and what actions they looked for.</p>
                <figure class="figure d-block">
                  <img src="assets/img/portfolio/talk.jpg" class="figure-img rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="talk">
                </figure>
                <p> I listed some of their problems: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> They want to see insights on the dashboard </li>
                  <li> they didn't have useful shortcuts to frequent actions </li>
                  <li> they have different experience in other similar panels and they didn't know how to use this one </li>
                  <li> they need to access support, guides ,and knowledgebase for publishing or writing their apps </li>
                </ul>
               
                <br>
                <br>
                <figure class="figure d-block">
                  <img src="assets/img/portfolio/olddashboard.jpg" class="figure-img rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="olddashboard">
                  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Myket's dashboard old look</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>I noticed that there was a lack of priority in presenting information, and new developers' data was different from the one who had apps so they should see the different dashboard for the first time and before publishing the app, also there wasn't a consistency between their application (that developers apps published on) and their dashboard.</p>
                <p>I looked at their application and its features and also I looked at other popular panels such as google play to research what an effective and friendly dashboard is and I reached to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> structured and consistent navigation </li>
                  <li> showing app insights </li>
                  <li> showing useful actions and information shortcuts </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2> Objective and Questions </h2>
                <p>I determined that our main objective is to increase developers' activity. so I start with some "How might We" questions:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li> How might we create a better experience for new developers to publish an app? </li>
                  <li> How might we engage them to do more activities? </li>
                  <li> How might we reduce calling support team? </li>
                </ul>
                <p> I realized that developers needed more details on how many times their app was downloaded or bought and also how could they customize their code to show on the AppStore. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2> The Redesign Process </h2>
                <p class="fw-bold">Card Sorting</p>
                <p> We did brainstorm and card sorting with the support team and some of the developers to see what should be removed or added </p>
                <figure class="figure d-block">
                  <img src="assets/img/portfolio/card.jpg" class="figure-img rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="card">
                </figure>
                <p class="fw-bold">Prototype and Feedback</p>
				<p>
				I designed a simple overview to get feedback, I asked the support team and our developers, and colleagues, to use it and I got their feedback then I asked some of our developer users to give me their feedback too My purpose was to estimate the result and discovering potential of satisfaction or any simple improvements that could be executed.
				</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2> The MVP </h2>
                <p> after launching it for 10% of users I checked the result again and it showed that it worked well so I started doing other improvements.. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Improve icons and make a consistency between menu icons and app icons </li>
                  <li> Improve actionability </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <figure class="figure d-block">
                  <img src="assets/img/portfolio/newdashboard.png" class="figure-img rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="newdashboard" style="border:1px solid #e2e2e2">
                  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">New designed dashboard</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
<p>				Finally, we launched the new dashboard and we received the developer's satisfaction. so we went to the next step to redesign the app list and ticketing parts too.</p>
